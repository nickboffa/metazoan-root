# Project Outline

1. The overall aims of your project (you can be brief, but provide links to key papers etc)
   The relatively simpler morphology of sponges (porifera) and all other metazoans meant that they were traditionally considered to be the first species to split in the metazoan clade, in line with the Great Chain of Being. However, 	Dunn et. al (2008; https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06614) determined that comb jellies (ctenophora) were the first to split, instigating a lengthy debate on the true root. Most recently, Schultz et. al (2023; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05936-6) claimed that synteny supports the ctenophora-sister hypothesis.

	Invariably, studies have used the outgroup rooting method. However, Naser-Khdour et. al (2022) recently demonstrated the efficacy of non-reversible amino acid models in rooting phylogenetic trees. This method has the advantage of removing the long branch of the outgroup from the tree, thus mitigating long branch attraction - an artifact thought to be contributing to the conflicting phylogenetic inferences. In this project, we aim apply this rooting method to the metazoan tree.
	
3. What dataset(s) you will use and why

4. A brief description of the dataset(s)

5. Describe a small subset of the data that you can test your code on (e.g. 10 or 20 loci; and if your dataset has a lot of species, a subset of those, how many you'll choose, and how you'll select them)

6. The plan for what commands you'll need to run your analysis, with a description of what each one does (e.g. IQ-TREE commands, ASTRAL commands). This can be an overview, but try to think through all the steps. Don't worry if you are unsure, just do your best. Feel free to try them out as you go, based on what you've learned in the tutorials. And if you need to do something that you don't know a command for (e.g. Select 10 species at random from your alignment) that's OK - just put what you want to do as a comment without code, and we can then all help each other figure out the best way to do things.

7. What you will measure and why (i.e. How you will know if what you are doing is good / is working / etc.)

   * Rootstrap support values
   * Bootstrap/UFBoot support values
